Project Neo

# AI/ML Software Engineering Portfolio
This portfolio demonstrates end-to-end expertise in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** through production-ready data pipelines, algorithms, evaluation functions, and scalable infrastructure.  

It is written entirely in **Python** and designed to highlight practical engineering skills for **enterprise clients** seeking advanced, reproducible AI/ML solutions to drive business value and revenue.

# Value Proposition
- Production-ready pipelines and infrastructure, not just research prototypes
- Customizable modules that can be adapted to specific business problems
- Proven scalability, aligning with enterprise-grade standards
- Revenue impact, demonstrated through KPIs and real-world applications

# Features
- **Data Pipelines**:  
  - Ingestion from CSV, JSON, API endpoints  
  - Data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering  
  - Scalable workflows for large datasets (filtering, mapping, reducing, and sorting functions)

- **Algorithms**:  
  - Supervised learning (classification, regression, forecasting)  
  - Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)  
  - Bayes' theorem, neural networks, support vector machines
  - Deep learning (NLP, computer vision, time-series models)  
  - Custom model implementations tailored to enterprise use cases  
  - Optimization. Backpropogation (gradient descent), constrained optimization, deduction

- **Evaluation Functions**:  
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1
  - Margin 
  - Posterior probabilities 
  - MSE, squared error, R^2
  - Business-aligned OKRs/KPIs for ROI, churn, and engagement  

- **Infrastructure**:  
  - Modular Python architecture with reusable components  
  - CI/CD readiness (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)  
  - Cloud-agnostic design (AWS, GC, Azure)  

# Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python (primary), SQL, Bash  
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, FastAPI  
- **DevOps & Infra**: Docker, Kubernetes (optional), GitHub Actions, Terraform  
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly  

# Prerequisites
Python 3.10+
pip or conda environment manager
